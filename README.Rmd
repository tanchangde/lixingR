# lixingr

An R language wrapper for the Lixinger API.

## User Guide

### Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of R is required. If lacking, it is recommended to quickly get started using [this material](https://tshi.page/r-and-tidyverse-book/index.html), estimated to take one or two hours.

### Installation

```r
devtools::install_github('tanchangde/lixingr')
```

### Configuration

-   Register and log in to Lixinger, then acquire a `Token` from the [Open Platform](https://www.lixinger.com/open/api/token).
-   Enter `file.edit("~/.Renviron")` in the R console, then append a new line to the opened file: `TOKEN_LIXINGER = "acquired Token"`, save and close the `.Renviron` file.
